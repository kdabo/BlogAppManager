# BlogAppManager âš¡

In this this project I examined the usage of React Router 4 components and it's features, 
from managing the transition between views to getting URL parameters easily. 
I also explored wiring up Redux Form helper to custom React components.

## The main features of the app

- get list of blog posts
- create new blog post
- delete blog post
- make one Redux Form field component per piece of state
- redux form handling input changes like for example onChange
- user submits the state
- validate input and handle form submission
